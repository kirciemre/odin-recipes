                    <p>Hamsi Tava, in English ‘Fried Anchovy’, is one of the famous Black Sea region seafood dish in Turkey. Hamsi is a small forage fish that has 144 species in 17 genera. In Turkey, they live in the Black Sea region, and their variety is called ‘European Anchovy’.

                        As you know Turkey is a country which has surrounded by 3 seas (Black Sea, Aegean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea) and we have special months for certain fish varieties. Within these three seas, the Black Sea is the coldest one, and the cold means fat for fish. The colder the sea, the fattier the fish. Hamsi period continues in Turkey from November to February which the Black Sea is at its coldest period. In Turkey, we say that if you are going to eat ‘Hamsi Tava’, wait until the first snow of the year.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, Hamsi’ has one of the best tastes within the forage fishes. The only downside of consuming Hamsi (European Anchovy) is the cleaning part. However, as natural, all the good things come with a price and the cleaning part is the price of this magnificent taste. If you are lucky, your local fish market may sell cleaned Anchovy. If not, you need to get dirty your hands. As the anchovies deteriorate faster than any other fish, you need the clean them as fast as you can. In Turkey, if you give extra money to the fish market guys, they clean them for you.</p>
