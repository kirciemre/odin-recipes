                    <p> Kebabs of all kinds are common in Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisines. This particular version is named after the city of Adana in Turkey, where it is said to have originated, and is traditionally made of minced lamb mounted on a skewer and grilled over charcoal.
                        Different cities and regions debate over how spicy the Adana kebab should be, but the inclusion of ground lamb as the choice of meat is a constant. This recipe seasons the lamb with onion, garlic, cumin, sumac, and red pepper flakes. The cooked kebabs are often served over warm flatbread to catch the drippings and are accompanied by roasted tomatoes, green or red peppers, sliced onions, and parsley. Less traditional, but equally delicious, would be to serve them over a bed of cooked basmati rice or an herbed couscous.

                        For this recipe, you'll need four metal skewers or wooden skewers that have been soaked in ice-cold water for an hour. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the recipe variations, some historical directions include a restriction on the type of lamb that can be used, the type and shape of the knife used to grind it, and even the exact dimensions of the skewers used to cook it. In modern times, however, most people buy lamb already ground, and the choice of skewer is usually just whether to opt for metal or wood. But variations in spiciness and additional ingredients, such as minced onion and garlic in the kebabs, are still up to each cook and vary by personal taste as well as the traditions of regions and countries.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
                        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground sumac, divided</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons ice water</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, minced onion and garlic, 1 teaspoon each of the ground cumin and sumac, salt, ground black pepper, red pepper flakes, and ice water. </li>
                        <li>Knead the mixture by hand until it turns tacky and starts sticking to the side of the bowl. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to chill. </li>
                        <li>Wet your hands and place a quarter of the lamb mixture onto each skewer. One easy method is to use a 1-ounce scoop to form balls, thread a few onto each skewer, and then mash them together to form the kebab shape. </li>
                        <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of ground cumin and sumac. </li>
                        <li>Grill the kebabs for approximately 12 minutes, until well charred on both sides. Sprinkle the spice mix over the kebabs while they are cooking. </li>
                        <li>If desired, serve the kebabs nestled in lettuce leaves with sliced red onion, parsley, tomatoes, and chopped cucumbers along with warm pita or naan bread. Enjoy. </li>
